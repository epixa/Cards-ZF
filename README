A web-based card game platform written for modern browsers.  The system can 
support any number of games as pluginable components.  Each game plugin is 
coupled to the core application, but the core application is not coupled to any 
specific games.

The frontend is developed for modern browsers with jQuery and CSS3.

The backend is developed with the Epixa library and Zend Framework on PHP 5.3.
